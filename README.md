For our project, we have chosen the location and context API for android devices.  This API returns information about nearby places as well as current locations. We have decided to use this information to develop an app for tourists seeking information about the location they are visiting. The app will give tourists information about local attractions, restaurants, grocery stores, and any other pertinent information for a tourist. The app will also provide information about the user's current location, historical information if available, restaurant menus, etc. We realize that this type of functionality is already available via google, however our goal is to combine all the information about locations into one app and make it as easy as possible for users to access.
